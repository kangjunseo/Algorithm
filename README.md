# Algorithm

This repository is for collecting `c++`(or `python`) codes when I used to solved algorithm problems.

Some codes' commit has information that I used which `algorithm` to solve this problem. (such as `DP(dynamic programming)`, `Brute force/BFS/DFS`, `Greedy`)

+Also there are some codes I submit at Algorithm Competition.
