# Algorithm

This repository is for collecting `c++`(or `python`) codes when I used to solved boj (algorithm solving site) problems.

Each code file's title is the `number` of boj problem, so just go to [BOJ SITE](https://www.acmicpc.net/) to check the problems!

Also some codes' commit has information that I used which `algorithm` to solve this problem. (such as `DP(dynamic programming)`, `Brute force/BFS/DFS`, `Greedy`)

<br/>
+ I also started to solve problems in Programmers too!
